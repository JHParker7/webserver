      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>My first introduction was Small Basic at 11 and soon after Python which to this day is my main language still around this time i also did SQL, html and css.
        At around 14 i started doing my own projects and experiments eventually during lock down(2020) i went a bit too far down the rabbit hole and learning about neural nets.
        A few months later started a L4 data analytics apprenticeship at hyde housing which within the first week i was  moved to the L7 AI data specialist course due to prior experience.
        During which i developed a variety of skills such as creating reports in power BI, how to use Terraform to deploy to the cloud and several new skills in AI due to the course itself.
        Which brings me to today where i am teaching my self front end development such as this website.
